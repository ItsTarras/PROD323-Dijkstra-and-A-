-  For the agent, it requires usage of a "Myself" tag for its trap to properly work.
  For this, open the agent prefab, and check its children properties. From here, ensure
  the corpse trap on the back has every part of it in the "Myself" layer.


- As well as this, if the post processing works, setting the main camera's layer to "Myself" also works.
  Unfortunately it might only work on my scene.


- There is also music attached to my agent for a bit of fun. Please ensure the speakers are at an acceptable level, otherwise we all may end up with tinnitus.

- Each tag has been applied appropriately. However, due to ambiguity within the assignment brief, I have only got capitalised versions of each tag.
  They are "Agent", "Goal", and "Obstacle" respectively.


- Agents will need to manually be placed in the Arena Manager listed under:
  ****TournamentTools**** > ArenaManager, in the inspector.
